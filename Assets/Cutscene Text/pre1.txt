It is the year 21XX. 
We have stopped reading books. We've stopped learning.
Why would we need to? All knowledge is a mere internet query away.
You wander the city streets, passing by several instances of police brutality.
Nothing much happens anymore.
Suddenly, you notice an old building, its door wooden. Rare.
You step inside. The building is filled with dusty, empty shelves.
Is it an old warehouse? Then, you see a shelf that isn't empty.
An ancient text? The words don't make much sense. 
To understand, you'll have to rediscover something in yourself.
