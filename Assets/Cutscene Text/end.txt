You turn the last page. 
You've read the lines, as well as between them.
You let the book slip shut and then back out of the building,
back onto the street.
You realize that not everything is perfect.
You realize that not everything is as others say it is.
You realize that there is potential, in imagination, to dream;
To look at words and from them draw a picture;
To dream of a future that is brighter and better.
And with this knowledge, perhaps you can change the world.
Perhaps you can teach the world again to read.
