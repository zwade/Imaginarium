#Imaginarium


The purpose of the game is to teach students about complex numbers, specifically in the context of phase shifts of the real domain. You will have different orbs whose positions are defined by complex numbers. Then you have to perform operations on them to move them to pedestals. Once they are all there, the level is complete.

Operations to include 
 
 - Addition/Subtraction
 - Multiplication/Division by real number
 - Multiplication/Division by imaginary number
 - Exponentiation
 - Roots of complex numbers
 - ??

Remember we need five levels taking 15-20 minutes total
